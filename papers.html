            <h2>Weather Forecasting Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms</h2>
            <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this study the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to Indian weather forecasting is investigated. We analyzed weather data from multiple cities using six machine learning methods such as CNNs and LSTMs and deep learning models including decision trees and random forests. The results indicate that deep learning approaches performed best in predicting temperature while decision tree regression performed best in predicting precipitation. These findings show the potential of advanced computer models to increase the accuracy of weather predictions with future research focusing on ensemble approaches and transfer learning for further optimization.</p>
            <p class="summary"><strong>Summary:</strong> This research examines the use of machine learning and deep learning to enhance weather forecasting in India. It contrasts different models, determining that deep learning methods such as CNNs and LSTMs are most suitable for temperature prediction, and decision trees are more suitable for precipitation. The study identifies the possibility of using AI to make forecasts more accurate and proposes improvements in the future with ensemble techniques and transfer learning.</p>
